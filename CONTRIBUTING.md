Contribute code
---------------

If you would like to contribute code and/or documentation directly, you are very welcome to open a pull
request with your contributions.

The following steps outline the workflow for code contributions:

* All pull requests should be linked to an existing issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/krnkl/revisor/issues).
* Open a new pull request. The pull request description should contain a summary of the changes and a
  reference to the respective issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/krnkl/revisor/issues).
* Your pull request will then be reviewed, and finally, if everything looks good, merged into master.

The project adheres to common Go code style conventions. `gometalinter` is used to check the code base.
